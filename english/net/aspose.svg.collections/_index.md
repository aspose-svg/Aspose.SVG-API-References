The **Aspose.Svg.Collections** namespace consists of classes to represent, store and manipulate nodes and elements.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [DOMTokenList](./domtokenlist/) | The DOMTokenList class represents a set of space-separated tokens. It is indexed beginning with 0 as with JavaScript Array objects. DOMTokenList is always case-sensitive. |
| [HTMLCollection](./htmlcollection/) | The [`HTMLCollection`](../aspose.svg.collections/htmlcollection/) represents a generic collection of [`Element`](../aspose.svg.dom/element/). |
| [NamedNodeMap](./namednodemap/) | Represents collections of attributes that can be accessed by name. |
| [NodeList](./nodelist/) | The NodeList provides the abstraction of an ordered collection of nodes, without defining or constraining how this collection is implemented. |
| [SVGListBase&lt;T&gt;](./svglistbase-1/) | This interface defines a base list of all SVG lists. |
