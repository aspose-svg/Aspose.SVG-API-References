The namespace represented by node filtering functionality. Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes. If a node iterator or tree walker is given a node filter, it applies the filter before it returns the next node. If the filter says to accept the node, the traversal logic returns it; otherwise, traversal looks for the next node and pretends that the node that was rejected was not there.
