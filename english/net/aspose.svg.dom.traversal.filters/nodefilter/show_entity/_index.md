## NodeFilter.SHOW_ENTITY field

Show Entity nodes. This is meaningful only when creating an iterator or tree-walker with an Entity node as its root; in this case, it means that the Entity node will appear in the first position of the traversal. Since entities are not part of the document tree, they do not appear when traversing over the document tree.

```csharp
public const long SHOW_ENTITY;
```
