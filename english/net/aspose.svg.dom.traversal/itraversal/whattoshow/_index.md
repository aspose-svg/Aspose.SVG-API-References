## ITraversal.WhatToShow property

This attribute determines which node types are presented via the iterator. The available set of constants is defined in the NodeFilter interface. Nodes not accepted by whatToShow will be skipped, but their children may still be considered. Note that this skip takes precedence over the filter, if any.

```csharp
public long WhatToShow { get; }
```
