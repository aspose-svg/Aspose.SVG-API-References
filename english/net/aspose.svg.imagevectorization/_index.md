## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| class [ImageTraceSimplifier](./imagetracesimplifier) | The ImageTraceSimplifier class is responsible reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of the trace points. |
| class [ImageTraceSmoother](./imagetracesmoother) | The ImageTraceSimplifier class is responsible for smoothing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of the trace points. This class implement nearest-neighbor approach. |
| class [ImageVectorizer](./imagevectorizer) | This ImageVectorizer class vectorizes raster images like PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP and etc... and returns SVGDocument. Under vectorization we mean the process of reducing bitmaps to geometric shapes made up from path elements and stored as SVG. |
| class [ImageVectorizerConfiguration](./imagevectorizerconfiguration) | The ImageVectorizerConfiguration class defines a configuration of image vectorization methods and options. The configuration is used to initialize an ImageVectorizer and provides the configuration options for vectorizing images. |
| class [PathBuilder](./pathbuilder) | The PathBuilder class is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg) from list of the trace points. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| interface [IImageTraceSimplifier](./iimagetracesimplifier) | The IImageTraceSimplifier interface is responsible for reduction of points in the trace. |
| interface [IImageTraceSmoother](./iimagetracesmoother) | The IImageTraceSmoother interface is responsible for smoothing trace. |
| interface [IPathBuilder](./ipathbuilder) | The IPathBuilder interface is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg) from list of the trace points. |
