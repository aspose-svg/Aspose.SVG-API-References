description: The Aspose.Svg.ImageVectorization namespace contains classes for vectorizing raster images and converting them to SVG documents. This process involves reducing bitmaps to geometric shapes made up from path elements and storing them as SVG. The namespace includes classes for building path segments simplifying and smoothing trace points and configuring vectorization options.

The **Aspose.Svg.ImageVectorization** namespace contains classes for vectorizing raster images and converting them to SVG documents. This process involves reducing bitmaps to geometric shapes made up from path elements and storing them as SVG. The namespace includes classes for building path segments, simplifying and smoothing trace points, and configuring vectorization options.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BezierPathBuilder](./bezierpathbuilder/) | The [`SplinePathBuilder`](../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/splinepathbuilder/) class is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](../aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg/) from list of the trace points. This path builder is based on using least-squares method to find Bezier control points for trace of points. |
| [ImageTraceSimplifier](./imagetracesimplifier/) | The ImageTraceSimplifier class is responsible reducing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of the trace points. |
| [ImageTraceSmoother](./imagetracesmoother/) | The ImageTraceSimplifier class is responsible for smoothing the number of points in a curve that is approximated by a series of the trace points. This class implement nearest-neighbor approach. |
| [ImageVectorizer](./imagevectorizer/) | This ImageVectorizer class vectorizes raster images like PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP and etc... and returns SVGDocument. Under vectorization we mean the process of reducing bitmaps to geometric shapes made up from path elements and stored as SVG. |
| [ImageVectorizerConfiguration](./imagevectorizerconfiguration/) | The [`ImageVectorizerConfiguration`](../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/imagevectorizerconfiguration/) class defines a configuration of image vectorization methods and options. The configuration is used to initialize an ImageVectorizer and provides the configuration options for vectorizing images. |
| [SplinePathBuilder](./splinepathbuilder/) | The [`SplinePathBuilder`](../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/splinepathbuilder/) class is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](../aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg/) from list of the trace points. This path builder is based on applying a Catmull-Roma spline to a set of smoothed and reduced path points.. |
| [StencilConfiguration](./stencilconfiguration/) | The [`StencilConfiguration`](../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/stencilconfiguration/) class defines a configuration of stencil effect options. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IImageTraceSimplifier](./iimagetracesimplifier/) | The IImageTraceSimplifier interface is responsible for reduction of points in the trace. |
| [IImageTraceSmoother](./iimagetracesmoother/) | The IImageTraceSmoother interface is responsible for smoothing trace. |
| [IPathBuilder](./ipathbuilder/) | The IPathBuilder interface is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](../aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg/) from list of the trace points. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [StencilType](./stenciltype/) | The [`StencilType`](../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/stenciltype/) enum defines stencil types. |
