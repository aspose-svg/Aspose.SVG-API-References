## PathBuilder.Tension property

The value of the tensions affects how sharply the curve bends at the (interpolated) control points. It must be in the range from 0 to 1. Any higher or lower values will be aligned with the minimum and maximum values of this range, accordingly.

```csharp
public float Tension { get; set; }
```
