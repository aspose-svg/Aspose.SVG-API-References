## BezierPathBuilder class

The [`SplinePathBuilder`](../splinepathbuilder) class is responsible for building path segments [`SVGPathSeg`](../../aspose.svg.paths/svgpathseg) from list of the trace points. This path builder is based on using least-squares method to find Bezier control points for trace of points.

```csharp
public class BezierPathBuilder : IPathBuilder
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BezierPathBuilder](bezierpathbuilder)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`BezierPathBuilder`](../bezierpathbuilder) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ErrorThreshold](../../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/bezierpathbuilder/errorthreshold) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the error threshold. This parameter defines maximum deviation of points to fitted curve. By default it is 30. |
| [MaxIterations](../../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/bezierpathbuilder/maxiterations) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the error threshold. This parameter defines number of iteration for least-squares approximation method. By default it is 30. |
| [TraceSmoother](../../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/bezierpathbuilder/tracesmoother) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the trace smoother. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Build](../../aspose.svg.imagevectorization/bezierpathbuilder/build)(IEnumerable&lt;PointF&gt;, SVGPathElement) | Builds path segments from the list of the trace points. |
