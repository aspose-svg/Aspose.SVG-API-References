## EventTarget.DispatchEvent method

This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event model.

```csharp
public bool DispatchEvent(Event @event)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| event | Event | Specifies the event type, behavior, and contextual information to be used in processing the event. |

### Return Value

The return value of `DispatchEvent` indicates whether any of the listeners which handled the event called [`PreventDefault`](../../../aspose.svg.dom.events/event/preventdefault). If [`PreventDefault`](../../../aspose.svg.dom.events/event/preventdefault) was called the value is false, else the value is true.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| [DOMException](../../domexception) |  |

### Remarks

Events dispatched in this manner will have the same capturing and bubbling behavior as events dispatched directly by the implementation. The target of the event is the [`EventTarget`](../../eventtarget) on which `DispatchEvent` is called.
