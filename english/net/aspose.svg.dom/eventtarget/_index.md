## EventTarget class

The [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) interface is implemented by all Nodes in an implementation which supports the DOM Event Model. Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface. The interface allows registration and removal of Event Listeners on an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) and dispatch of events to that [`IEventTarget`](../../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventtarget).

```csharp
public class EventTarget : DOMObject, IDisposable, IEventTarget
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AddEventListener](addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [AddEventListener](addeventlistener)(string, DOMEventHandler, bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [AddEventListener](addeventlistener)(string, IEventListener, bool) | This method allows the registration of event listeners on the event target. |
| [DispatchEvent](dispatchevent)(Event) | This method allows the dispatch of events into the implementations event model. |
| [Dispose](dispose)() | Performs application-defined tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources. |
| [RemoveEventListener](removeeventlistener)(string, IEventListener) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
| [RemoveEventListener](removeeventlistener)(string, DOMEventHandler, bool) | This method allows the removal of event listeners from the event target. If an [`IEventListener`](../../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) is removed from an [`EventTarget`](../eventtarget) while it is processing an event, it will not be triggered by the current actions. Event Listeners can never be invoked after being removed. |
