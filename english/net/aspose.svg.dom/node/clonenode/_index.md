## CloneNode() {#clonenode}

Returns a duplicate of the node on which this method was called.

Cloning a node copies all of its attributes and their values, including intrinsic (inline) listeners. It does not copy event listeners added using [`AddEventListener`](../../../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventtarget/addeventlistener/) or those assigned to element properties (e.g., node.onclick = someFunction). Additionally, for a HTMLCanvasElement element, the painted image is not copied.

```csharp
public Node CloneNode()
```

### Return Value

The new [`Node`](../) cloned. The cloned node has no parent and is not part of the document, until it is added to another node that is part of the document, using [`AppendChild`](../appendchild/) or a similar method.

## CloneNode(*bool*) {#clonenode_1}

Returns a duplicate of the node on which this method was called. Its parameter controls if the subtree contained in a node is also cloned or not.

Cloning a node copies all of its attributes and their values, including intrinsic (inline) listeners. It does not copy event listeners added using [`AddEventListener`](../../../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventtarget/addeventlistener/) or those assigned to element properties (e.g., node.onclick = someFunction). Additionally, for a HTMLCanvasElement element, the painted image is not copied.

```csharp
public Node CloneNode(bool deep)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| deep | Boolean | If true, then the node and its whole subtree, including text that may be in child [`Text`](../../text/) nodes, is also copied. |

### Return Value

The new [`Node`](../) cloned. The cloned node has no parent and is not part of the document, until it is added to another node that is part of the document, using [`AppendChild`](../appendchild/) or a similar method.
