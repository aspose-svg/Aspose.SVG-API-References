## SVGDocument class

An `SVGDocument` is the root of the SVG hierarchy and holds the entire content. Besides providing access to the hierarchy, it also provides some convenience methods for accessing certain sets of information from the document. When an ‘svg’ element is embedded inline as a component of a document from another namespace, such as when an ‘svg’ element is embedded inline within an XHTML document [XHTML], then an SVGDocument object will not exist; instead, the root object in the document object hierarchy will be a Document object of a different type, such as an HTMLDocument object. However, an SVGDocument object will indeed exist when the root element of the XML document hierarchy is an ‘svg’ element, such as when viewing a stand-alone SVG file(i.e., a file with MIME type "image/svg+xml"). In this case, the SVGDocument object will be the root object of the document object model hierarchy.

```csharp
public class SVGDocument : Document, IDocumentCSS
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [SVGDocument](svgdocument)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`SVGDocument`](../svgdocument) class. |
| [SVGDocument](svgdocument)(Configuration) | Initializes a new instance of the [`SVGDocument`](../svgdocument) class. |
| [SVGDocument](svgdocument)(RequestMessage) | Initializes a new instance of the [`SVGDocument`](../svgdocument) class.
