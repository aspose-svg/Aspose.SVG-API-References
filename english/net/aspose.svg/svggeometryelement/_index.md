## SVGGeometryElement class

Interface SVGGeometryElement represents SVG elements whose rendering is defined by geometry with an equivalent path, and which can be filled and stroked. This includes paths and the basic shapes.

```csharp
public class SVGGeometryElement : SVGGraphicsElement
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [PathLength](pathlength) { get; } | Corresponds to attribute pathLength on the given element. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetPointAtLength](getpointatlength)(float) | Returns the (x,y) coordinate in user space which is distance units along the path, utilizing the user agent's distance-along-a-path algorithm. |
| [GetTotalLength](gettotallength)() | Returns the user agent's computed value for the total length of the path using the user agent's distance-along-a-path algorithm, as a distance in the current user coordinate system. |
