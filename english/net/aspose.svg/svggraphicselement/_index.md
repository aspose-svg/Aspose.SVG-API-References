## SVGGraphicsElement class

The SVGGraphicsElement interface represents SVG elements whose primary purpose is to directly render graphics into a group.

```csharp
public class SVGGraphicsElement : SVGElement, ISVGTests
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FarthestViewportElement](farthestviewportelement) { get; } | The farthest ancestor ‘svg’ element. Null if the current element is the outermost svg element. |
| [NearestViewportElement](nearestviewportelement) { get; } | The element which established the current viewport. Often, the nearest ancestor ‘svg’ element. Null if the current element is the outermost svg element. |
| [RequiredExtensions](requiredextensions) { get; } | Corresponds to attribute ‘requiredExtensions’ on the given element. |
| [RequiredFeatures](requiredfeatures) { get; } | Corresponds to attribute ‘requiredFeatures’ on the given element. |
| [SystemLanguage](systemlanguage) { get; } | Corresponds to attribute ‘systemLanguage’ on the given element. |
| [Transform](transform) { get; } | Corresponds to attribute ‘transform’ on the given element. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetBBox](getbbox)() | Returns the tight bounding box in current user space (i.e., after application of the ‘transform’ attribute, if any) on the geometry of all contained graphics elements, exclusive of stroking, clipping, masking and filter effects). Note that getBBox must return the actual bounding box at the time the method was called, even in case the element has not yet been rendered. |
| [GetCTM](getctm)() | Returns the transformation matrix from current user units (i.e., after application of the ‘transform’ attribute, if any) to the viewport coordinate system for the nearestViewportElement. |
| [GetScreenCTM](getscreenctm)() | Returns the transformation matrix from current user units (i.e., after application of the ‘transform’ attribute, if any) to the parent user agent's notice of a "pixel". For display devices, ideally this represents a physical screen pixel. For other devices or environments where physical pixel sizes are not known, then an algorithm similar to the CSS2 definition of a "pixel" can be used instead. Note that null is returned if this element is not hooked into the document tree. This method would have been more aptly named as getClientCTM, but the name getScreenCTM is kept for historical reasons. |
