## IXPathNamespace.OwnerElement property

The [`Element`](../../../aspose.svg.dom/element) on which the namespace was in scope when it was requested. This does not change on a returned namespace node even if the document changes such that the namespace goes out of scope on that element and this node is no longer found there by XPath.

```csharp
public Element OwnerElement { get; }
```
