The **Aspose.Svg.Drawing** namespace contains objects and interfaces to specify measurement and units as well as drawing attribute objects like brushes, colors and fonts.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Angle](./angle/) | The angle data type |
| [Color](./color/) | The Color class lets you specify colors as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values, Hue-Saturation-Luminosity (HSL) values, Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) values, Hue-Whiteness-Blackness (HWB) values, lightness-A-B (LAB) values, Luminance-Chroma-Hue (LCH) values, Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key (CMYK) values, Natural colors (NCOL) values, or with a color name. An Alpha channel is also available to indicate transparency. |
| [Dimension](./dimension/) | Provides the base class for dimensions. The general term 'dimension' refers to a number with a unit attached to it, and are denoted by [`UnitType`](../aspose.svg.drawing/unittype/). |
| [Frequency](./frequency/) | The 'frequency' unit. |
| [Length](./length/) | Represents a length measurement unit. |
| [LengthOrAuto](./lengthorauto/) | Represents a container for storage length or 'auto' units.. |
| [Margin](./margin/) | Represents page margin. |
| [Numeric](./numeric/) | Provides the base class for numeric types. |
| [Page](./page/) | Represents a page object is used for configuration output page. The lacuna value for page size is A4(210x297mm) |
| [Resolution](./resolution/) | Represents a resolution unit. |
| [Size](./size/) | Stores a values which specify a Height and Width. |
| [Time](./time/) | Represents a time unit. |
| [Unit](./unit/) | Provides the base class for units of measurement. |
| [UnitType](./unittype/) | Specifies the unit of measurement. |
