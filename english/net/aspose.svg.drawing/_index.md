The **Aspose.Svg.Drawing** namespace contains objects and interfaces to specify measurement and units as well as drawing attribute objects like brushes, colors and fonts.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Angle](./angle/) | The angle data type |
| [Color](./color/) | The Color class lets you specify colors as Red-Green-Blue (RGB) values, Hue-Saturation-Luminosity (HSL) values, Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) values, Hue-Whiteness-Blackness (HWB) values, lightness-A-B (LAB) values, Luminance-Chroma-Hue (LCH) values, Cyan-Magenta-Yellow-Key (CMYK) values, Natural colors (NCOL) values, or with a color name. An Alpha channel is also available to indicate transparency. |
| [Dimension](./dimension/) | Provides the base class for dimensions. The general term 'dimension' refers to a number with a unit attached to it, and are denoted by [`UnitType`](../aspose.svg.drawing/unittype/). |
| [Frequency](./frequency/) | The 'frequency' unit. |
| [Length](./length/) | Represents a length measurement unit. |
| [LengthOrAuto](./lengthorauto/) | Represents a container for storage length or 'auto' units.. |
| [Margin](./margin/) | Represents page margin. |
| [Numeric](./numeric/) | Provides the base class for numeric types. |
| [Page](./page/) | Represents a page object is used for configuration output page. The lacuna value for page size is A4(210x297mm) |
| [Resolution](./resolution/) | Represents a resolution unit. |
| [Size](./size/) | Stores a values which specify a Height and Width. |
| [Time](./time/) | Represents a time unit. |
| [Unit](./unit/) | Provides the base class for units of measurement. |
| [UnitType](./unittype/) | Specifies the unit of measurement. |
| [Viewport](./viewport/) | Represents a viewport that defines the width and height of a visual area. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IBrush](./ibrush/) | Declares method for getting of brush type. |
| [ICodec](./icodec/) | Represents a codec for decoding images. |
| [IColorComponents](./icolorcomponents/) | Declares method and properties for processing color components. |
| [IDrawingFactory](./idrawingfactory/) | Represents a factory for creating drawing-related objects. |
| [IGradientBrush](./igradientbrush/) | Declare methods for getting common properties of gradient brushes. |
| [IInterpolationColor](./iinterpolationcolor/) | Desclares methods for getting interpolation color. |
| [ILinearGradientBrush](./ilineargradientbrush/) | Defines an interface for a brush with a linear gradient. |
| [IMatrix](./imatrix/) | Represents a matrix used for transformations. |
| [IPixelsMap](./ipixelsmap/) | Represents a map of pixel data. |
| [ISolidBrush](./isolidbrush/) | Defines brush interface of a single color |
| [ITextureBrush](./itexturebrush/) | Defines brush interface that uses an image to fill the interior of a shape. |
| [ITransformableBrush](./itransformablebrush/) | Desclares methods for getting transformation matrix and wrap mode. |
| [ITrueTypeFont](./itruetypefont/) | Declares methods for working with TrueType fonts. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BrushType](./brushtype/) | Specifies the type of brush. |
| [ColorModel](./colormodel/) | This enumeration is used to select the color model for working with color components. |
| [ColorSpace](./colorspace/) | Specifies the color space or color model used in a pixel map [`IPixelsMap`](../aspose.svg.drawing/ipixelsmap/). |
| [FillRule](./fillrule/) | Specifies the fill rule used in rendering SVG and HTML. |
| [SpreadMode](./spreadmode/) | Specifies how a texture or gradient is tiled when it is smaller than the area being filled. |
| [StrokeLineCap](./strokelinecap/) | Specifies the line cap used in rendering SVG and HTML. |
| [StrokeLineJoin](./strokelinejoin/) | Specifies the line join style used in rendering SVG and HTML. |
| [WebFontStyle](./webfontstyle/) |  |
| [WebImageFormat](./webimageformat/) | Specifies the supported image formats. |
| [WebMatrixOrder](./webmatrixorder/) | Specifies the order in which matrix transformations are applied. |
