## WebRotateFlipType enumeration

Specifies the rotation and flip operation to apply to an image.

```csharp
public enum WebRotateFlipType
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RotateNoneFlipNone | `0` | No rotation and no flipping. |
| Rotate90FlipNone | `1` | Rotate 90 degrees clockwise with no flipping. |
| Rotate180FlipNone | `2` | Rotate 180 degrees with no flipping. |
| Rotate270FlipNone | `3` | Rotate 270 degrees clockwise with no flipping. |
| RotateNoneFlipX | `4` | No rotation with a horizontal flip (flip along the X-axis). |
| Rotate90FlipX | `5` | Rotate 90 degrees clockwise followed by a horizontal flip (flip along the X-axis). |
| Rotate180FlipX | `6` | Rotate 180 degrees followed by a horizontal flip (flip along the X-axis). |
| Rotate270FlipX | `7` | Rotate 270 degrees clockwise followed by a horizontal flip (flip along the X-axis). |
| RotateNoneFlipY | `6` | No rotation with a vertical flip (flip along the Y-axis). This is equivalent to Rotate180FlipX. |
| Rotate90FlipY | `7` | Rotate 90 degrees clockwise followed by a vertical flip (flip along the Y-axis). This is equivalent to Rotate270FlipX. |
| Rotate180FlipY | `4` | Rotate 180 degrees followed by a vertical flip (flip along the Y-axis). This is equivalent to RotateNoneFlipX. |
| Rotate270FlipY | `5` | Rotate 270 degrees clockwise followed by a vertical flip (flip along the Y-axis). This is equivalent to Rotate90FlipX. |
| RotateNoneFlipXY | `2` | No rotation with both a horizontal and vertical flip (flip along both axes). This is equivalent to Rotate180FlipNone. |
| Rotate90FlipXY | `3` | Rotate 90 degrees clockwise followed by both a horizontal and vertical flip (flip along both axes). This is equivalent to Rotate270FlipNone. |
| Rotate180FlipXY | `0` | Rotate 180 degrees followed by both a horizontal and vertical flip (flip along both axes). This is equivalent to RotateNoneFlipNone. |
| Rotate270FlipXY | `1` | Rotate 270 degrees clockwise followed by both a horizontal and vertical flip (flip along both axes). This is equivalent to Rotate90FlipNone. |
