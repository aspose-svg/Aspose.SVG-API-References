In addition to standard IO (input-output) tools the **Aspose.Svg.IO** namespace contains helper classes and interfaces.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FileCreateStreamProvider](./filecreatestreamprovider/) | Represents FileStream implementation for providing streams to the rendering devices. |
| [LocalFileSystemStorage](./localfilesystemstorage/) | A file system storage. |
| [OutputStream](./outputstream/) | A surrogate stream wraps the real output stream and controls access to it. [`OutputStream`](../aspose.svg.io/outputstream/) contains URI data that describes location of the output stream. |
| [OutputStreamContext](./outputstreamcontext/) | A context for initialization of the output stream. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IBlob](./iblob/) | A Blob object refers to a byte sequence, and has a size attribute which is the total number of bytes in the byte sequence, and a type attribute, which is an ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the byte sequence. |
| [ICreateStreamProvider](./icreatestreamprovider/) | Represents an interface that can be implemented by classes providing streams to the rendering devices. |
| [IFile](./ifile/) | A File object is a Blob object with a name attribute, which is a string; it can be created within the web application via a constructor, or is a reference to a byte sequence from a file from the underlying (OS) file system. |
| [IFileList](./ifilelist/) | Represent the interface for list of files. |
| [IOutputStorage](./ioutputstorage/) | Provides the creation and management of output streams [`OutputStream`](../aspose.svg.io/outputstream/). |
