## CompositeOperator enumeration

Specifies the type of compositing operation to be applied in SVG compositing operations.

```csharp
public enum CompositeOperator
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Over | `0` | Places the source graphic over the destination graphic. |
| In | `1` | Displays the source graphic where it overlaps the destination graphic. |
| Out | `2` | Displays the source graphic where it does not overlap the destination. |
| Atop | `3` | Displays the source graphic atop the destination graphic. |
| Xor | `4` | Displays the source graphic where it does not overlap the destination and vice versa. |
| Arithmetic | `5` | Allows for a custom arithmetic compositing operation. |

## Remarks

Compositing operations in SVG determine how two graphic elements are combined into a single image. Each operator defines a distinct method of blending or combining these elements.
