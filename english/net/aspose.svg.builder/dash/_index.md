## Dash enumeration

Defines the pattern of dashes and gaps used to paint the outline of shapes (stroke) in SVG elements.

```csharp
public enum Dash
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0` | Indicates a solid stroke with no dashes. This is the default behavior when 'stroke-dasharray' is not specified. |

## Remarks

The 'stroke-dasharray' attribute in SVG is used to create dashed lines by specifying the pattern of dashes and gaps. This enumeration provides options for setting this pattern.
