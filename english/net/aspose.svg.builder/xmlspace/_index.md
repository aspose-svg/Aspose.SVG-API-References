## XmlSpace enumeration

Specifies how white space inside elements is handled in XML documents.

```csharp
public enum XmlSpace
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | `0` | Indicates that white space should be handled according to the XML processor's default behavior, typically normalizing white space by removing line breaks and extra spaces. |
| Preserve | `1` | Indicates that white space should be preserved as it appears in the XML document. This is useful for maintaining the formatting of text where white space is significant. |

## Remarks

The 'xml:space' attribute in XML is used to control whether white space inside elements should be preserved or normalized. This enumeration provides options for setting this behavior in XML and SVG documents.
