## ChannelSelector enumeration

Specifies the channel selectors for use in SVG filter operations.

```csharp
public enum ChannelSelector
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R | `0` | Selects the Red channel of the image. |
| G | `1` | Selects the Green channel of the image. |
| B | `2` | Selects the Blue channel of the image. |
| A | `3` | Selects the Alpha (transparency) channel of the image. |

## Remarks

Channel selectors are used in various SVG filter primitives to target specific color channels (Red, Green, Blue) or the alpha channel of an image. This allows for precise manipulation of these channels during filter processing.
