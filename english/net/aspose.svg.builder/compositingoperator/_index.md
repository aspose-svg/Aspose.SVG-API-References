## CompositingOperator enumeration

Specifies the type of compositing operation to be applied in SVG masking operations.

```csharp
public enum CompositingOperator
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add | `0` | Adds the color values of the source graphic to the destination graphic. |
| Subtract | `1` | Subtracts the color values of the source graphic from the destination graphic. |
| Intersect | `2` | Displays only the areas where both the source and destination graphics overlap. |
| Exclude | `3` | Excludes the overlapping areas of the source and destination graphics. |

## Remarks

Compositing operators in SVG masks determine how different graphic elements are combined to create a mask effect. Each operator defines a unique method of blending or combining these elements to achieve various masking effects.
