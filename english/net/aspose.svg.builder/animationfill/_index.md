## AnimationFill enumeration

Specifies the behavior of the animation before and after its execution.

```csharp
public enum AnimationFill
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Freeze | `0` | The animation will apply the property values for the time the animation ended. |
| Remove | `1` | The animation will not apply any values after it finishes executing. |

## Remarks

The 'fill' attribute in SVG animations controls what values are applied by the animation outside the time it is executing. This enum provides options for controlling these behaviors.
