## ImageRendering enumeration

Specifies how an image should be rendered in SVG.

```csharp
public enum ImageRendering
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auto | `0` | The browser makes a trade-off between speed and quality when rendering the image. |
| OptimizeSpeed | `1` | The browser emphasizes rendering speed over image quality. This often means scaling images in a way that might make them look pixelated or blocky. |
| OptimizeQuality | `2` | The browser emphasizes image quality over rendering speed. This can mean smoother, higher quality scaling of images but might result in slower rendering. |
