## MutationObserver class

A [`MutationObserver`](../mutationobserver) object can be used to observe mutations to the tree of [`Node`](../../aspose.svg.dom/node).

```csharp
public class MutationObserver : DOMObject
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [MutationObserver](mutationobserver)(MutationCallback) | Constructs a MutationObserver object and sets its [`MutationCallback`](../mutationcallback) to callback. The callback is invoked with a list of MutationRecord objects as first argument and the constructed MutationObserver object as second argument. It is invoked after nodes registered with the !:Observe(Node, IMutationObserverInit) method, are mutated. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Disconnect](disconnect)() | Stops observer from observing any mutations. Until the observe() method is used again, observer’s callback will not be invoked. |
| [Observe](observe)(Node) | Instructs the user agent to observe a given target (a node) and report any mutations based on the criteria given by options (an object). The options argument allows for setting mutation observation options via object members. |
| [Observe](observe)(Node, MutationObserverInit) | Instructs the user agent to observe a given target (a node) and report any mutations based on the criteria given by options (an object). The options argument allows for setting mutation observation options via object members. |
| [TakeRecords](takerecords)() | The method returns a copy of the record queue and then empty the record queue. |
