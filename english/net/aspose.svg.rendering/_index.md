The **Aspose.Svg.Rendering** namespace consists of numerous renderer objects as well as appropriate low level options classes which are responsible to render documents/files into IDevice implementation.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CssOptions](./cssoptions/) | Represents css rendering options. |
| [Device](./device/) | Represents a base class for implementing rendering devices that are used to draw graphics in various formats and environments. |
| [Device&lt;TGraphicContext,TRenderingOptions&gt;](./device-2/) | Represents base class for implementation particular rendering devices. |
| [DeviceAdapter](./deviceadapter/) | Represents a device adapter that adapts the interface of the wrapped device. |
| [GraphicContext](./graphiccontext/) | Holds current graphics control parameters. These parameters define the global framework within which the graphics operators execute. |
| [PageSetup](./pagesetup/) | Represents a page setup object is used for configuration output page-set. |
| [Renderer](./renderer/) | Represents a base class for all renderers and implemnts IDisposable interface. |
| [Renderer&lt;TSource&gt;](./renderer-1/) | The base abstract class for all renderers. |
| [RenderingOptions](./renderingoptions/) | Represents rendering options. |
| [SvgRenderer](./svgrenderer/) | Represents SVG document renderer. |
| [TextInfo](./textinfo/) | Contains information about rendered text. |

| [ICanvasContext](./icanvascontext/) | Represents the context of an HTML canvas 2D drawing. |
| [ICanvasFactory](./icanvasfactory/) | Represents a factory for creating instances of the canvas. |
| [ICanvasPathFactory](./icanvaspathfactory/) | Represents a factory for creating canvas paths. |
| [IDevice](./idevice/) | Defines methods and properties that support custom rendering of the graphic elements like paths, text and images. |
| [IPath](./ipath/) | Represents a path for defining shapes or outlines. |

## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AtPagePriority](./atpagepriority/) | Specifies possible orders of applying page size declarations. |
| [ClipStrategy](./clipstrategy/) | Specifies the strategy for clipping an SVG element. This enum is used to determine how to apply clipping paths or masks to SVG elements during rendering. |
