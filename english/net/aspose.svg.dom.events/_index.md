The **Aspose.Svg.Dom.Events** namespace provides objects for any events related DOM updating. It includes subscription to specific contextual information observation associated with event as well as custom events construction.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CustomEvent](./customevent) | Events using the CustomEvent interface can be used to carry custom data. |
| [DocumentLoadErrorEvent](./documentloaderrorevent) | The [`DocumentLoadErrorEvent`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/documentloaderrorevent) occurres when the requested resource is not available. |
| [DOMEventHandler](./domeventhandler) | Represents the callback for event handling. |
| [ErrorEvent](./errorevent) | The [`ErrorEvent`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/errorevent) provides contextual information about an errors that occurred during runtime. |
| [Event](./event) | The [`Event`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/event) is used to provide contextual information about an event to the handler processing the event. |
| [FocusEvent](./focusevent) | The FocusEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with Focus events. |
| [InputEvent](./inputevent) | Input events are sent as notifications whenever the DOM is being updated. |
| [KeyboardEvent](./keyboardevent) | The KeyboardEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with keyboard devices. Each keyboard event references a key using a value. Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element that has the focus. |
| [MouseEvent](./mouseevent) | The MouseEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with Mouse events. |
| [UIEvent](./uievent) | The UIEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with User Interface events. |
| [WheelEvent](./wheelevent) | The WheelEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with wheel events. To create an instance of the WheelEvent interface, use the WheelEvent constructor, passing an optional WheelEventInit dictionary. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IDocumentEvent](./idocumentevent) | The [`IDocumentEvent`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/idocumentevent) interface provides a mechanism by which the user can create an [`Event`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/event) of a type supported by the implementation. |
| [IEventListener](./ieventlistener) | The [`IEventListener`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) interface is the primary method for handling events. Users implement the [`IEventListener`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) interface and register their listener on an [`EventTarget`](../aspose.svg.dom/eventtarget) using the [`AddEventListener`](../aspose.svg.dom/eventtarget/addeventlistener) method. The users should also remove their [`IEventListener`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) from its [`EventTarget`](../aspose.svg.dom/eventtarget) after they have completed using the listener. |
| [IEventTarget](./ieventtarget) | The [`EventTarget`](../aspose.svg.dom/eventtarget) interface is implemented by all Nodes in an implementation which supports the DOM Event Model. Therefore, this interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Node interface. The interface allows registration and removal of Event Listeners on an [`EventTarget`](../aspose.svg.dom/eventtarget) and dispatch of events to that [`IEventTarget`](../aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventtarget). |
