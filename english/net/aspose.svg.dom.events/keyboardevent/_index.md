## KeyboardEvent class

The KeyboardEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with keyboard devices. Each keyboard event references a key using a value. Keyboard events are commonly directed at the element that has the focus.

```csharp
public class KeyboardEvent : UIEvent
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [KeyboardEvent](keyboardevent)(string) | Initializes a new instance of the [`KeyboardEvent`](../keyboardevent) class. |
| [KeyboardEvent](keyboardevent)(string, IDictionary&lt;string, object&gt;) | Initializes a new instance of the [`KeyboardEvent`](../keyboardevent) class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AltKey](altkey) { get; } | true if the Alt (alternative) (or "Option") key modifier was active. The un-initialized value of this attribute MUST be false. |
| [Code](code) { get; } | The code holds a string that identifies the physical key being pressed. The value is not affected by the current keyboard layout or modifier state, so a particular key will always return the same value. |
| [CtrlKey](ctrlkey) { get; } | true if the Control (control) key modifier was active. The un-initialized value of this attribute MUST be false. |
| [IsComposing](iscomposing) { get; } | true if the key event occurs as part of a composition session, i.e., after a compositionstart event and before the corresponding compositionend event. The un-initialized value of this attribute MUST be false. |
| [Key](key) { get; } | The key holds the key value of the key pressed. If the value is has a printed representation, it MUST be a non-empty Unicode character string, conforming to the algorithm for determining the key value defined in this specification. If the value is a control key which has no printed representation, it MUST be one of the key values defined in the key values set, as determined by the algorithm for determining the key value. Implementations that are unable to identify a key MUST use the key value Unidentified. |
| [Location](location) { get; } | The location attribute contains an indication of the logical location of the key on the device. |
| [MetaKey](metakey) { get; } | true if the meta (Meta) key modifier was active. |
| [Repeat](repeat) { get; } | true if the key has been pressed in a sustained manner. Holding down a key MUST result in the repeating the events keydown, beforeinput, input in this order, at a rate determined by the system configuration. For mobile devices which have long-key-press behavior, the first key event with a repeat attribute value of true MUST serve as an indication of a long-key-press. The length of time that the key MUST be pressed in order to begin repeating is configuration-dependent. |
| [ShiftKey](shiftkey) { get; } | true if the shift (Shift) key modifier was active. |
