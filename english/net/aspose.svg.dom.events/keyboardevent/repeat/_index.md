## KeyboardEvent.Repeat property

true if the key has been pressed in a sustained manner. Holding down a key MUST result in the repeating the events keydown, beforeinput, input in this order, at a rate determined by the system configuration. For mobile devices which have long-key-press behavior, the first key event with a repeat attribute value of true MUST serve as an indication of a long-key-press. The length of time that the key MUST be pressed in order to begin repeating is configuration-dependent.

```csharp
public bool Repeat { get; }
```

## Property Value

`true` if repeat; otherwise, `false`.
