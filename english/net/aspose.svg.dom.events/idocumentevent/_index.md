## IDocumentEvent interface

The `IDocumentEvent` interface provides a mechanism by which the user can create an [`Event`](../event/) of a type supported by the implementation.

```csharp
public interface IDocumentEvent
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CreateEvent](../../aspose.svg.dom.events/idocumentevent/createevent/)(string) | Creates an [`Event`](../event/) of a type supported by the implementation. |

## Remarks

It is expected that the `IDocumentEvent` interface will be implemented on the same object which implements the [`Document`](../../aspose.svg.dom/document/) interface in an implementation which supports the Event model.
