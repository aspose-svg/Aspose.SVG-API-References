## Event.InitEvent method

The `InitEvent` method is used to initialize the value of an [`Event`](../../event) created through the [`IDocumentEvent`](../../idocumentevent) interface.

```csharp
public void InitEvent(string type, bool bubbles, bool cancelable)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | String | The event type. |
| bubbles | Boolean | if set to `true` [bubbles]. |
| cancelable | Boolean | if set to `true` [cancelable]. |

### Remarks

This method may only be called before the Event has been dispatched via the [`DispatchEvent`](../../ieventtarget/dispatchevent) method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times the final invocation takes precedence. If called from a subclass of Event interface only the values specified in the initEvent method are modified, all other attributes are left unchanged.
