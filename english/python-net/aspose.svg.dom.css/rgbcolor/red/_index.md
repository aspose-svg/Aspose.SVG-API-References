## red property


Gets the red component value of this Color class.

### Remarks 


The color of each pixel is represented as a 32-bit number: 8 bits each for alpha, red, green, and blue (ARGB). The alpha component specifies the transparency of the color: 0 is fully transparent, and 255 is fully opaque. Likewise, an A value of 255 represents an opaque color. An A value from 1 through 254 represents a semitransparent color. The color becomes more opaque as A approaches 255.
### Definition:

    ...
