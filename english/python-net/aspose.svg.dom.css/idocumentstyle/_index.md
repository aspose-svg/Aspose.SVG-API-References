## IDocumentStyle class

The DocumentStyle interface provides a mechanism by which the style sheets embedded in a document can be retrieved. The expectation is that an instance of the DocumentStyle interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Document interface.



The IDocumentStyle type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [style_sheets](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.css/idocumentstyle/style_sheets) | A list containing all the style sheets explicitly linked into or embedded in a document. For HTML documents, this includes external style sheets, included via the HTML LINK element, and inline STYLE elements. |
