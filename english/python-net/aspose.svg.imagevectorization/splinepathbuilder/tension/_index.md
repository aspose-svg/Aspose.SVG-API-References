## tension property


The value of the tensions affects how sharply the curve bends at the (interpolated) control points.
It must be in the range from 0 to 1. Any higher or lower values will be aligned with the minimum and maximum values of this range, accordingly.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def tension(self):
    ...
@tension.setter
def tension(self, value):
    ...
```
