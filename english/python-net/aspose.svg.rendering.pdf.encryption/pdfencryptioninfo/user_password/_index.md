## user_password property


Gets or sets the User password.

### Remarks 


Opening the document with the correct user password (or opening a document
that does not have a user password) allows additional operations to be
performed according to the user access permissions specified in the document’s
encryption dictionary.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def user_password(self):
    ...
@user_password.setter
def user_password(self, value):
    ...
```
