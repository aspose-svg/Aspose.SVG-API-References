## type property


The ASCII-encoded string in lower case representing the media type of the Blob.
On getting, user agents must return the type of a Blob as an ASCII-encoded string in lower case, 
such that when it is converted to a byte sequence, it is a parsable MIME type, 
or the empty string – 0 bytes – if the type cannot be determined.
