The **Aspose.Svg.Dom.XPath**  namespace contains methods to
navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document.

### Classes
| Class | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`IXPathEvaluator`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathevaluator) | The evaluation of XPath expressions is provided by [`IXPathEvaluator`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathevaluator). |
| [`IXPathExpression`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathexpression) | The `XPathExpression` interface represents a parsed and resolved XPath expression. |
| [`IXPathNSResolver`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathnsresolver) | The `XPathNSResolver` interface permit `prefix` strings in <br/>the expression to be properly bound to `namespaceURI` strings. <br/>[`IXPathEvaluator`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathevaluator) can construct an implementation of <br/>[`IXPathNSResolver`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathnsresolver) from a node, or the interface may be <br/>implemented by any application. |
| [`IXPathNamespace`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathnamespace) | The XPathNamespace interface is returned by XPathResult interfaces to represent the XPath namespace node type that DOM lacks. |
| [`IXPathResult`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathresult) | The `XPathResult` interface represents the result of the evaluation of an <br/>XPath 1.0 expression within the context of a particular node. Since evaluation <br/>of an XPath expression can result in various result types, this object makes it <br/>possible to discover and manipulate the type and value of the result. |


### Enumerations
| Enumeration | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`XPathResultType`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/xpathresulttype) | An unsigned short indicating what type of result this is. If a specific <br/>`type` is specified, then the result will be returned as the corresponding <br/>type, using XPath type conversions where required and possible. |
