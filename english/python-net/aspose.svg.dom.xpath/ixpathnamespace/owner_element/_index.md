## owner_element property


The [`Element`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/element) on which the namespace was in scope when it was requested. 
This does not change on a returned namespace node even if the document changes such 
that the namespace goes out of scope on that element and this node is no longer found 
there by XPath.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def owner_element(self):
    ...
```
