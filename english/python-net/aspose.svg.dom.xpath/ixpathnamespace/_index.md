## IXPathNamespace class

The XPathNamespace interface is returned by XPathResult interfaces to represent the XPath namespace node type that DOM lacks.



The IXPathNamespace type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [owner_element](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.xpath/ixpathnamespace/owner_element) | The [`Element`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/element) on which the namespace was in scope when it was requested. <br/>This does not change on a returned namespace node even if the document changes such <br/>that the namespace goes out of scope on that element and this node is no longer found <br/>there by XPath. |
