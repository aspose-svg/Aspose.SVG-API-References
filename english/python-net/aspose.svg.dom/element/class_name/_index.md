## class_name property


The class attribute of the element. This attribute has been renamed due
to conflicts with the "class" keyword exposed by many languages. See
the class attribute definition in HTML 4.01.
### Definition:

@property
def class_name(self):
    ...
@class_name.setter
def class_name(self, value):
