## show_image_placeholders property


Images can have fallback content: content that should be used when an external resource cannot be used (for example, because it is in an unsupported format). The property [`IUserAgentService.show_image_placeholders`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.services/iuseragentservice#show_image_placeholders) specifies whether to display the fallback image (default is true)
### Definition:
```python
@property
def show_image_placeholders(self):
    ...
@show_image_placeholders.setter
def show_image_placeholders(self, value):
    ...
```
