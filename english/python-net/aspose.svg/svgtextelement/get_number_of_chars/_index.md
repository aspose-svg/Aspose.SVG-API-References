## get_number_of_chars {#}

Returns the total number of characters available for rendering within the current element, which includes referenced characters from ‘tref’ reference, regardless of whether they will be rendered. Effectively, this is equivalent to the length of the Node::textContent attribute from DOM Level 3 Core ([DOM3], section 1.4), if that attribute also expanded ‘tref’ elements.


### Returns 


Total number of characters.


```python
def get_number_of_chars(self):
    ...
```
