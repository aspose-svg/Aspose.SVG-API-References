## animated_path_seg_list property


Provides access to the current animated contents of the ‘d’ attribute in a form which matches one-for-one with SVG's syntax. If the given attribute or property is being animated, contains the current animated value of the attribute or property, and both the object itself and its contents are read only. If the given attribute or property is not currently being animated, contains the same value as pathSegList.
### Definition:

def animated_path_seg_list(self):
