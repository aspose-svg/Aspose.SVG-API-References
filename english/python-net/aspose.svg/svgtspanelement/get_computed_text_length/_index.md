## get_computed_text_length {#}

The total sum of all of the advance values from rendering all of the characters within this element, including the advance value on the glyphs (horizontal or vertical), the effect of properties ‘kerning’, ‘letter-spacing’ and ‘word-spacing’ and adjustments due to attributes ‘dx’ and ‘dy’ on ‘tspan’ elements. For non-rendering environments, the user agent shall make reasonable assumptions about glyph metrics.
