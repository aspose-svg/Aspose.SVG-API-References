## ISVGAnimatedPoints class

The SVGAnimatedPoints interface supports elements which have a ‘points’ attribute which holds a list of coordinate values and which support the ability to animate that attribute.
Additionally, the ‘points’ attribute on the original element accessed via the XML DOM(e.g., using the getAttribute() method call) will reflect any changes made to points.



The ISVGAnimatedPoints type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [points](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg/isvganimatedpoints/points) | Provides access to the base (i.e., static) contents of the ‘points’ attribute. |
| [animated_points](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg/isvganimatedpoints/animated_points) | Provides access to the current animated contents of the ‘points’ attribute. If the given attribute or property is being animated, contains the current animated value of the attribute or property. If the given attribute or property is not currently being animated, contains the same value as points. |
