The **Aspose.Svg.Rendering.Styles**  namespace contains classes and interfaces
defining various style properties of SVG elements during rendering. This includes
color schemes, gradients, patterns, fill styles, and other stylistic elements that 
influence the visual appearance of the SVG elements.

These styles are essential for maintaining the integrity of the SVG documents 
and ensuring they are rendered as per the original design specifications.
