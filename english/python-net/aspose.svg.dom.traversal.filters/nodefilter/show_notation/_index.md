## SHOW_NOTATION property


Show Notation nodes. This is meaningful only when creating 
an iterator or tree-walker with a Notation node as its 
root; in this case, it means that the 
Notation node will appear in the first position of the 
traversal. Since notations are not part of the document tree, they do 
not appear when traversing over the document tree.
