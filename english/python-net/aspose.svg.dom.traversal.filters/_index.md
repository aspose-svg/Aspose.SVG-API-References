The namespace represented by node filtering functionality.
Filters are objects that know how to "filter out" nodes.
If a node iterator or tree walker is given a node filter,
it applies the filter before it returns the next node.
If the filter says to accept the node, the traversal logic
returns it; otherwise, traversal looks for the next node and
pretends that the node that was rejected was not there.
