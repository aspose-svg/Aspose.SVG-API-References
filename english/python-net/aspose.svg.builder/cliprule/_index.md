## ClipRule enumeration

Defines the rule to determine how to clip paths in SVG graphics.



The ClipRule type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONZERO | The nonzero winding rule for clipping paths. |
| EVENODD | The even-odd winding rule for clipping paths. |



### Remarks 


The clip rule property in SVG determines how paths are clipped. It is particularly important when a path intersects with itself or when multiple paths are combined. The rule helps in deciding which parts of the path are "inside" and should be filled (or visible) and which are "outside" and should be clipped (or invisible).
