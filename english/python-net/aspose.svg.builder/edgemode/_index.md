## EdgeMode enumeration

Specifies the edge mode for the feConvolveMatrix filter primitive in SVG.



The EdgeMode type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| DUPLICATE | The input image is extended along each of its borders as necessary by duplicating the color values at the given edge of the input image. |
| WRAP | The input image is conceptually wrapped (or tiled) and the convolution uses these wrapped values. This creates a toroidal topology for the image. |
| NONE | The edge mode is not defined, and the effect of the filter is defined by the implementation. |
