## AnimationSplineBuilder class

A builder class for constructing animation timing functions using cubic Bézier curves.
This class allows for the definition of one or more cubic Bézier curves, each specified by two control points.
The resulting string can be used in CSS animations or transitions to control the pace of the animation.



The AnimationSplineBuilder type exposes the following members:
