## LengthType enumeration

Specifies the units of measurement for lengths in SVG.



The LengthType type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NUMBER | Represents a numeric value without any unit. It is often interpreted in the context of other values or default units. |
| PERCENTAGE | Represents a percentage value, relative to another value or a bounding dimension. |
| EMS | Represents a length in 'ems', a scalable unit that is relative to the current font size. |
| EXS | Represents a length in 'exs', related to the x-height of the current font. |
| PX | Represents a length in pixels, a unit of measurement based on the digital representation of an image. |
| CM | Represents a length in centimeters. |
| MM | Represents a length in millimeters. |
| IN | Represents a length in inches. |
| PT | Represents a length in points, a traditional unit in typography. 1 point is approximately 1/72 of an inch. |
| PC | Represents a length in picas, a typographic unit of measurement. 1 pica is equivalent to 12 points. |
