| PRE | White space is preserved; text is only wrapped where it contains newline characters. |
| NO_WRAP | White space is collapsed; text does not wrap. |
| PRE_WRAP | White space is preserved; text wraps where necessary and on newline characters. |
| BREAK_SPACES | White space is preserved; line breaks are added to fill line boxes. |
| PRE_LINE | White space is preserved; text wraps where necessary, but no newline characters. |
