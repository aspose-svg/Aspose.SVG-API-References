## CompositingOperator enumeration

Specifies the type of compositing operation to be applied in SVG masking operations.



The CompositingOperator type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| ADD | Adds the color values of the source graphic to the destination graphic. |
| SUBTRACT | Subtracts the color values of the source graphic from the destination graphic. |
| INTERSECT | Displays only the areas where both the source and destination graphics overlap. |
| EXCLUDE | Excludes the overlapping areas of the source and destination graphics. |



### Remarks 


Compositing operators in SVG masks determine how different graphic elements are combined to create a mask effect. Each operator defines a unique method of blending or combining these elements to achieve various masking effects.
