## ShapeRendering enumeration

Specifies the shape rendering mode for SVG elements.



The ShapeRendering type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| AUTO | The browser makes trade-offs between speed, smoothness, and geometric precision when rendering shapes. |
| OPTIMIZE_SPEED | The browser emphasizes rendering speed over geometric precision and smoothness. This mode can lead to faster rendering but less accurate shapes. |
| CRISP_EDGES | The browser attempts to preserve sharp edges and corners. This mode is useful for rendering graphics with straight lines and edges. |
| GEOMETRIC_PRECISION | The browser emphasizes geometric precision in rendering at the cost of speed. This mode is suitable for high-quality rendering where precise geometry is important. |
