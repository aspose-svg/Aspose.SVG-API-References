## ImageRendering enumeration

Specifies how an image should be rendered in SVG.



The ImageRendering type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| AUTO | The browser makes a trade-off between speed and quality when rendering the image. |
| OPTIMIZE_SPEED | The browser emphasizes rendering speed over image quality. This often means scaling images in a way that might make them look pixelated or blocky. |
| OPTIMIZE_QUALITY | The browser emphasizes image quality over rendering speed. This can mean smoother, higher quality scaling of images but might result in slower rendering. |
