## AnimationFill enumeration

Specifies the behavior of the animation before and after its execution.



The AnimationFill type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| FREEZE | The animation will apply the property values for the time the animation ended. |
| REMOVE | The animation will not apply any values after it finishes executing. |



### Remarks 


The 'fill' attribute in SVG animations controls what values are applied by the animation outside the time it is executing.
This enum provides options for controlling these behaviors.
