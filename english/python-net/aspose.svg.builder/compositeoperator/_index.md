## CompositeOperator enumeration

Specifies the type of compositing operation to be applied in SVG compositing operations.



The CompositeOperator type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| OVER | Places the source graphic over the destination graphic. |
| IN | Displays the source graphic where it overlaps the destination graphic. |
| OUT | Displays the source graphic where it does not overlap the destination. |
| ATOP | Displays the source graphic atop the destination graphic. |
| XOR | Displays the source graphic where it does not overlap the destination and vice versa. |
| ARITHMETIC | Allows for a custom arithmetic compositing operation. |



### Remarks 


Compositing operations in SVG determine how two graphic elements are combined into a single image. Each operator defines a distinct method of blending or combining these elements.
