## Dash enumeration

Defines the pattern of dashes and gaps used to paint the outline of shapes (stroke) in SVG elements.



The Dash type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONE | Indicates a solid stroke with no dashes. This is the default behavior when 'stroke-dasharray' is not specified. |



### Remarks 


The 'stroke-dasharray' attribute in SVG is used to create dashed lines by specifying the pattern of dashes and gaps. This enumeration provides options for setting this pattern.
