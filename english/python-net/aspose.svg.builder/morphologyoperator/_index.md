## MorphologyOperator enumeration

Specifies the type of morphological operation to be applied in SVG filters.



The MorphologyOperator type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| ERODE | Erodes the graphics, making the shapes smaller and the edges smoother. |
| DILATE | Dilates the graphics, making the shapes larger and the edges more pronounced. |



### Remarks 


This enumeration is used in the context of SVG filters to define the type of morphological operation. Morphological operations are used to process the shape and structure of elements in an image, typically for eroding or dilating the graphics.
