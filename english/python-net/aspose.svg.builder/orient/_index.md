## Orient enumeration

Specifies the orientation of the marker relative to the shape it is attached to.



The Orient type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| AUTO | The marker is oriented in such a way that it points in the direction of the path. |
| AUTO_START_REVERSE | The marker is oriented in the reverse direction of the path's start. |



### Remarks 


The 'orient' attribute in SVG markers determines how the marker is oriented when it is placed at its position on the shape.
This enum provides options for setting the orientation behavior of markers.
