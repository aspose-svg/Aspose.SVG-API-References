## AspectRatioScaling enumeration

Specifies the scaling behavior for SVG elements when preserving their aspect ratio.



The AspectRatioScaling type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| MEET | Scales the SVG element to fit within the viewport while preserving its aspect ratio. <br/>If the aspect ratio of the viewport does not match the element, extra space will be distributed evenly along the axis that has more space. |
| SLICE | Scales the SVG element to fill the viewport while preserving its aspect ratio. <br/>If the aspect ratio of the viewport does not match the element, the element will be clipped to fit. |
