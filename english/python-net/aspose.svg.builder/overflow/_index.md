## Overflow enumeration

Specifies the overflow behavior for SVG elements.



The Overflow type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| VISIBLE | Content that exceeds the bounds of the element is visible. |
| HIDDEN | Content that exceeds the bounds of the element is clipped and not visible. |
| SCROLL | Provides scrollbars for the content that exceeds the bounds of the element. |



### Remarks 


This enumeration controls how content that exceeds the bounds of an SVG element is displayed. It determines whether the excess content is visible, clipped, or provided with scrollbars.
