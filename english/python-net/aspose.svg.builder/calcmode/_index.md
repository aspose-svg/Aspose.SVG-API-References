## CalcMode enumeration

Specifies the calculation modes for interpolating values in SVG animations.



The CalcMode type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| DISCRETE | The animation jumps from one value to the next without any interpolation. |
| LINEAR | The animation values are interpolated linearly across the animation duration. |
| PACED | The animation is paced so that the progress is even across the entire animation. |
| SPLINE | The animation uses cubic Bézier splines to interpolate values. |



### Remarks 


The calculation mode determines how an SVG animation transitions between values over the course of the animation. Different modes can be used to create various effects and control the animation's pacing and smoothness.
