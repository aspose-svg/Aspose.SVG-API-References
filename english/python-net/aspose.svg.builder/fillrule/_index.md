## FillRule enumeration

Specifies the rule to determine what parts of a shape are inside or outside in SVG graphics.



The FillRule type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NONZERO | The nonzero winding rule: Determines the "insideness" of a point in the shape by drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction and counting the number of path segments from the given shape that the ray crosses. If this number is odd, the point is inside; if even, the point is outside. |
| EVENODD | The even-odd winding rule: Determines the "insideness" of a point in the shape by drawing a ray from that point to infinity in any direction and counting the number of path segments from the given shape that the ray crosses. If this number is even, the point is outside; if odd, the point is inside. |
