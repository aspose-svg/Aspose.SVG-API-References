## BaseLineShift enumeration

Specifies the vertical position of an element relative to its baseline in SVG.



The BaseLineShift type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| SUB | Aligns the baseline of the element with the subscript baseline of the parent's text. |
| SUPER | Aligns the baseline of the element with the superscript baseline of the parent's text. |
| TOP | Aligns the top of the element with the top of the line box. |
| CENTER | Centers the element in the line box. |
| BOTTOM | Aligns the bottom of the element with the bottom of the line box. |



### Remarks 


The 'baseline-shift' attribute in SVG is used to adjust the vertical position of an element relative to its baseline, which is particularly useful in text rendering. This enum provides various options for shifting the baseline to achieve different text effects.
