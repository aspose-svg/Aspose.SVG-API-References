## ColorInterpolation enumeration

Specifies the color interpolation mode for SVG elements and filters.



The ColorInterpolation type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| AUTO | Automatically determines the color interpolation mode. |
| SRGB | Uses the standard RGB color space (sRGB) for color interpolation. |
| LINEAR_RGB | Uses a linear RGB color space for color interpolation. |



### Remarks 


Color interpolation in SVG affects how colors are calculated and blended in both graphical elements and filter effects. Different modes can significantly impact the appearance of color transitions, gradients, and overall color rendering. This setting is crucial for achieving the desired visual outcome in SVG graphics.
