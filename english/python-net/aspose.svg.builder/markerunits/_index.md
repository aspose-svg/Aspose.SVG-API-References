## MarkerUnits enumeration

Specifies the coordinate system for the marker size in SVG.



The MarkerUnits type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| STROKE_WIDTH | The size of the marker is relative to the stroke width of the path. |
| USER_SPACE_ON_USE | The size of the marker is based on the user coordinate system, making it independent of the stroke width. |



### Remarks 


This enumeration defines the coordinate system used to calculate the size of markers in SVG. It determines whether the marker size is relative to the stroke width or based on the user coordinate system.
