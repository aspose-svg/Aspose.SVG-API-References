## Location class

Location objects provide a representation of the address of the active document of their Document's browsing context, and allow the current entry of the browsing context's session history to be changed, by adding or replacing entries in the history object.



**Inheritance:** [`Location`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.window/location) → 
[`DOMObject`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/domobject)
