## delta_x property


In user agents where the default action of the wheel event is to scroll, the value MUST be the measurement along the x-axis (in pixels, lines, or pages) to be scrolled in the case where the event is not cancelled. Otherwise, this is an implementation-specific measurement (in pixels, lines, or pages) of the movement of a wheel device around the x-axis.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def delta_x(self):
    ...
@delta_x.setter
def delta_x(self, value):
    ...
```
