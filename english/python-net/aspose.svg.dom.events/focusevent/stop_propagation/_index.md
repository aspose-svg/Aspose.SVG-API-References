## stop_propagation {#}

The [`Event.stop_propagation`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.events/event/stop_propagation) method is used prevent further propagation of an event during event flow.



```python
def stop_propagation(self):
    ...
```


### Remarks

If this method is called by any [`IEventListener`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventlistener) the event will cease propagating through the tree.
The event will complete dispatch to all listeners on the current [`IEventTarget`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.events/ieventtarget) before event flow stops.
This method may be used during any stage of event flow.
