## create_tree_walker {#aspose.svg.dom.Node}

Create a new TreeWalker over the subtree rooted at the
specified node.


### Returns 


The newly created TreeWalker.


```python
def create_tree_walker(self, root):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| root | [`Node`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/node) | node which will serve as the root for the<br/>TreeWalker. The whatToShow flags and the<br/>NodeFilter are not considered when setting this value;<br/>any node type will be accepted as the root. The<br/>currentNode of the TreeWalker is<br/>initialized to this node, whether or not it is visible. The<br/>root functions as a stopping point for traversal<br/>methods that look upward in the document structure, such as<br/>parentNode and nextNode. The root must<br/>not be null. |


## create_tree_walker {#aspose.svg.dom.Node-int}

Create a new TreeWalker over the subtree rooted at the
specified node.


### Returns 


The newly created TreeWalker.


```python
def create_tree_walker(self, root, what_to_show):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| root | [`Node`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/node) | node which will serve as the root for the<br/>TreeWalker. The whatToShow flags and the<br/>NodeFilter are not considered when setting this value;<br/>any node type will be accepted as the root. The<br/>currentNode of the TreeWalker is<br/>initialized to this node, whether or not it is visible. The<br/>root functions as a stopping point for traversal<br/>methods that look upward in the document structure, such as<br/>parentNode and nextNode. The root must<br/>not be null. |
| what_to_show | int | flag specifies which node types may appear in<br/>the logical view of the tree presented by the tree-walker. See the<br/>description of NodeFilter for the set of possible<br/>SHOW_ values.These flags can be combined using OR. |


## create_tree_walker {#aspose.svg.dom.Node-int-aspose.svg.dom.traversal.INodeFilter}

Create a new TreeWalker over the subtree rooted at the
specified node.


### Returns 


The newly created TreeWalker.


```python
def create_tree_walker(self, root, what_to_show, filter):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| root | [`Node`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom/node) | node which will serve as the root for the<br/>TreeWalker. The whatToShow flags and the<br/>NodeFilter are not considered when setting this value;<br/>any node type will be accepted as the root. The<br/>currentNode of the TreeWalker is<br/>initialized to this node, whether or not it is visible. The<br/>root functions as a stopping point for traversal<br/>methods that look upward in the document structure, such as<br/>parentNode and nextNode. The root must<br/>not be null. |
| what_to_show | int | flag specifies which node types may appear in<br/>the logical view of the tree presented by the tree-walker. See the<br/>description of NodeFilter for the set of possible<br/>SHOW_ values.These flags can be combined using OR. |
| filter | [`INodeFilter`](/svg/python-net/aspose.svg.dom.traversal/inodefilter) | NodeFilter to be used with this<br/>TreeWalker, or null to indicate no filter. |
